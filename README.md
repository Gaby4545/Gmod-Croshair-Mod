<h1>Gmod-Croshair-Mod</h1>


<h2>Bio</h2>
First, my name is Gabriel and I live in Canada in the Quebec province. That means I'm also french and may make errors in english but I understand it fairly well. 

<h2>Functionality</h2>
At this moment, it is pretty useless, but I'm planning to make it work like CS:GO for the convars and stuff. So for now there is a basic hud Gui but no way to make Popup. I plan on using the F4 key but it will be changable in a config. 

<table>
        <tr><td><h4>TODO</h4></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Add a config</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Add the HUD piece whith the croshair</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Finish the options in the GUI</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Client side saving</td></tr>
</table>
